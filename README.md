I'm a data scientist and software developer based in Dunedin, New Zealand.
Prior to working as a developer with
[ADInstruments](https://github.com/adinstruments), I was a neuroscience
researcher. This is my personal GitHub profile but you can find links to my
external projects below too.

[**PhysIO**](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/tree/master/PhysIO):
a novel Hilbert-based method for improved processing of respiratory signals as
part of the PhysIO functional MRI denoising toolbox.
 + Role: Devised and implemented a new signal processing approach for
   physiological data, based on a novel application of ideas from EEG/MEG
   research.

[**pd-apathy**](https://github.com/nzbri/pd-apathy): Analysis of the predictors
of apathy for patients with Parkinson's disease.
 + Role: Formulated the longitudinal modelling approach and performed the
   analysis.

[**solar_analyses**](https://github.com/sharrison5/solar_analyses): Analysis of
the output from a home solar system.
 + Role: Developed the probabilistic model and implemented the sampling scheme
   to do Bayesian inference using Stan.
 + Personal project.

### :robot: Machine Learning

[**genbed**](https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas/tree/master/genbed):
toolbox for classification and visualisation, designed for computational
psychiatry workflows.
 + Role: Put together the functionality needed to provide a sensible default
   workflow for classification, with a focus on visualisation and
   interpretation of the outputs.

[**Pyro**](http://pyro.ai/examples/boosting_bbvi.html): Tutorial for performing
boosting black-box variational inference in Pyro.
 + Role: co-supervised a student project based on adapting a novel variational
   inference technique to new deep learning frameworks.
 + Based at the [Translational Neuromodeling Unit](https://www.tnu.ethz.ch/),
   ETH Zurich.
 + Code: <https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro/pull/2308>
 + Tutorial: <http://pyro.ai/examples/boosting_bbvi.html>
